# Sidekix
Site was developed by using **HTML**,**CSS** and **Javascript**.

Here is the link: [Sidekix](https://sidekix.ro/).

The site's theme is **Swipe** and was copied from [getBootsrap](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/) and I tried to recreate it.

Following,changes were done manually like:

- I built the site's structure using different sections like `<div class="hero">` or `<div class="partners-section">` to get a better understanding of the content.

- Every section created was styled in the **CSS** file.

- Used a lot of **flexbox** and also **grid** for different sections.It helped me a lot to put the content to fit perfectly into the page.

- The **Js** files were generated for the linear gradient on the page.

- The **site** content is about promoting a company for **software development**.

Here is a **screenshot** of the sections well grouped with the **gradient** created with **javascript**: ![Sidekix screenshot](/Sidekix.png)

This is my first project,could have been a lot better,will make another projects,but overall,I think it is a nice beginning.
